# Smoke-Detection-using-ML
### Detect smoke with the help of IOT data and trigger a fire alarm
##  Backgroud of the problem statement 

Smoke detectors save a lot of lives. For example, the number of fire victims fell by more than 48% in France from 1982 to 2012 and 56% in the UK from 1982 to 2013. These reductions can largely be linked to increased fire safety regulations and smoke detectors (Source). In the U.S. 96% of all homes have smoke alarms and approximately 20% of homes with smoke alarms have non-operational smoke alarms. It is estimated that if every home had working smoke alarms, U.S. residential fire deaths could drop by 36%, with nearly 1100 lives saved per year (Source). With an increasing number of smoke detectors, false alarms became a problem (Source). The number of false fire alarms is increasing continuously, which is a severe issue for firefighters.
